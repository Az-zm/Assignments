# Assignments
In Task 1 I have taken input 2 numbers as input with integer datatype(float datatype could also be used) and performed some mathematical operations such as addition,subtraction,multiplication and division.
In Task 2 I have taken 2 strings as input to form a full name and then concatenated them with a sentence to print a final sentence of greeting.
Since these are some basic programs i do not have much to explain about them.
